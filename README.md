# Wordlist Combiner

Wordlist Combiner is a Python tool built with the sole purpose of combining multiple wordlists into one wordlist, this is and excellent script to use when doing bruteforcing (with permission) and you don't know which one wordlist to use.

## USAGE

It's Very Easy, Just Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohabgabber/wordlistcombiner.git && python script.py
```
Then you have to type the file you want the wordlists to be combined into
```python
[-] Please Type The File You Wanna Write Into: {YOUR FILE HERE}
```
Then type all the wordlists you wanna combine with a space between each one, like this:
```python
[-] Please Type All The Wordlists You Wanna Combine (One Space Seperated): {WORDLIST1} {WORDLIST2} {WORDLIST3} {ETC...}
```
If everything is correct then you'll receive this:
```python
[-] Done Combining [A LIST OF YOUR WORDLISTS] into {THE MERGED WORDLISTS' FILE}
```
